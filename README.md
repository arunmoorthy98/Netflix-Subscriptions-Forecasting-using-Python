# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting-using-Python
Forecasting the number of subscriptions Netflix will achieve in a time period is a vital business practice that enables them to plan, strategize, and make data-driven decisions. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, ultimately contributing to their success and growth in the highly competitive streaming industry.
Process We Can Follow :
Using techniques like time series forecasting, Netflix can estimate the expected number of new subscribers in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business. Below is the process we can follow to forecast subscription counts for Netflix:

Gather historical Netflix subscriptions growth data
Preprocess and clean the data
Explore and analyze time series patterns
Choose a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
Train the model using the training data
Forecast future Netflix subscription counts
So the process for forecasting subscriptions for Netflix starts with collecting a dataset based on the historical growth of Netflix Subscribers.
I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the dataset from here:https://statso.io/forecasting-subscriptions-case-study/
Now letâ€™s get started with Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA to forecast the number of subscriptions of Netflix using Python. I will start by converting the data into a time series format:



time_series = data.set_index('Time Period')['Subscribers']
Here we are converting the original DataFrame into a time series format, where the Time Period column becomes the index, and the Subscribers column becomes the data
Summary
Using techniques like time series forecasting, Netflix can estimate the expected number of new subscribers in a given time period and better understand the growth potential of their business. It enhances operational efficiency, financial planning, and content strategy, ultimately contributing to their success and growth in the highly competitive streaming industry.
